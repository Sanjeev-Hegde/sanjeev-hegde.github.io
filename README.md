# Sanjeev Hegde Portfolio

The live version can be seen <a href="https://sanjeev-hegde.github.io">here</a>
<br/><br/>
Currently, this project is written using pure HTML and Javascript without using any frameworks<br/>
Although this is very simple for now, I am planning to add project categories, blogs section etc.<br/>
So I will be rewriting this using ReactJs soon. 

You can freely clone or fork this repository, make changes to build your own portfolio.<br/>
Please provide **Star** if this is helpful for you.
